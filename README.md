I was having trouble uploading some of the folders so only Lesson 2 folder was uploaded fully.

Lesson 3 files are Mikondatabase.db and server3.js.
My database was tested with Postman and worked as intended with both GET and POST.

Lesson 4 folder was divided into four parts that were uploaded separately:
1. Webhook. I created my own Discord-server and tested the webhook there. Once again trouble with uploading the files so I ended up just uploading the server.js file alone.
2. Websocket. Websocket worked as intended and echoed the message back to the website.
3. Fetch. Fetch worked as intended and fetched the test results from my ThingSpeak Weather Station.
4. Google Chart. This one I couldn't figure out and didn't have the time to anymore but played around with it and tried different things. I ended up just writing down the data myself.
